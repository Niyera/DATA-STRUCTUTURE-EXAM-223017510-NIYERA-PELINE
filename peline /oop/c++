question 1 it's about program which prints hello world

#include  : This includes a library that allows us to print anything by using "cout".
	<iostream : incuding input and output in a program you are doing.
	using namespace std  : help programer to write in easy way without wring std::.... IN each line of code.
int main ()  :  its a function where program start .
cout :  help programmmer to print output on screen.
	return 0 : it end the program successfull with  zero error.


 
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	cout <<"hello, world";
	return 0;
}
 
 question 2 ;This question is dealing with variables, data type and values of variables

 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
 int age = 20; // Integer variable
 double price = 19.99; // Double variable
 char grade = 'A'; // Character variable
 string name = "Alice"; // String variable
 cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
 cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
 cout << "Price: $" << price << endl;
 cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
 
 return 0;
}


 question 3 it's about



#include <iostream>
 using namespace std;

int main() {
    string name;
    int age;

    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin >> name;

    cout << "Enter your age: ";
    cin >> age;

    cout << "Hello, " << name << "! You are " << age << " years old." << endl;

    return 0;
}

 question 4 it's about 


 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int a = 10, b = 3;
cout << "Sum: " << a + b << endl;
cout << "Difference: " << a - b << endl;
cout << "Product: " << a * b << endl;
cout << "Quotient: " << a / b << endl;
cout << "Remainder: " << a % b << endl;

    return 0;
}
